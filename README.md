# MGS406 Final Project: Flight Reservation Database #
The flight reservation project aims to develop a prototypical web application that allows users to reserve flights. The application will have a user-friendly interface designed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to ensure a responsive and visually appealing user experience across different devices supported by backend Python.
Upon accessing the application, users will be greeted with a welcoming page introducing the flight reservation system. From there, they will have the option to reserve flight or view reservations.
Users can click on reserve flight and will proceed to a reservation page where they can provide personal information, search and select flights based on their preferred criteria, such as departure and arrival destinations and dates. After confirming the reservation, they will be redirected to a confirmation page with a summary of their booking and a unique reservation number.
The application will also feature a reservation list page where users can view past and current flight reservations. This page will retrieve and display the relevant data from a MySQL database, ensuring easy access to reservation details for users.
